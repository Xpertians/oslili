# OSLiLi - Open Source License Identification Library

Open Source License Identification Library is an experimental code, that use Scikit-learn to implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained with SPDX data to identify Open Source Licenses. This should be consider as a proof of concept for identify Open Source licenses using Machine Learning. 

This is an experimental project, please don't use it for production. For a more robust implementation, please check the project Askalono https://github.com/jpeddicord/askalono


## Usage

### On the command line

You can use OSLiLi in your terminal as command line, please install the oslili-cli package:
```
$ pip3 install oslili-cli
$ oslili-cli LICENSE
License: MIT (0.89 probability)
Copyright: ('2021', '(c)  Andrew Barrier')
```
### As a library

In order to use the library, you need to import and use identify_license or identify_copyright.
```
import argparse
from oslili import LicenseAndCopyrightIdentifier


def main():
    msg = 'Identify open source license and copyright statements'
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=msg)
    parser.add_argument('file_path', help='Path to the file to analyze')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    file_path = args.file_path

    with open(args.file_path, 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()

    identifier = LicenseAndCopyrightIdentifier()
    license_spdx_code, license_proba = identifier.identify_license(text)
    print(f'License: {license_spdx_code} ({license_proba:.2f} probability)')
    year_range, statement = identifier.identify_copyright(text)
    if statement:
        if None not in statement:
            print(f'Copyright: {statement}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
## Notice

This tool does not provide legal advice and it is not a lawyer. It endeavors to match your input to a database of similar license texts, and tell you what it thinks is a close match. But, it can't tell you that the given license is authoritative over a project. Nor can it tell you what to do with a license once it's identified. You are not entitled to rely on the accuracy of the output of this tool, and should seek independent legal advice for any licensing questions that may arise from using this tool.

### Where do the licenses come from?

License data is sourced directly from SPDX: https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data
